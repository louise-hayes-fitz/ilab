# Umbrella Insurance
Umbrella Insurance is a global insurance company that offers homeowners, commercial and property insurance.

## Umbrella Homeowners Insurance
Umbrella Homeowners insurance provides financial protection against disasters. It is a pack-
age policy, which means that it covers both damage to property and liability, or
legal responsibility, for any injuries and property damage policyholders or their
families cause to other people. This includes damage caused by household pets.
Damage caused by most disasters is covered but there are exceptions. Standard
homeowners policies do not cover flooding, earthquakes or poor maintenance.
Flood coverage, however, is available in the form of a separate policy both from
the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and from a few private insur-
ers. Earthquake coverage is available either in the form of an endorsement or
as a separate policy. Most maintenance-related problems are the homeowners’
responsibility.
A standard homeowners insurance policy includes four essential types of
coverage. They include:

### 1. Coverage for the Structure of the Home
This part of a policy pays to repair or rebuild a home if it is damaged or
destroyed by fire, hurricane, hail, lightning or other disaster listed in the policy.
It will not pay for damage caused by a flood, earthquake or routine wear and
tear. Most standard policies also cover structures that are not attached to a
house such as a garage, tool shed or gazebo. Generally, these structures are cov-
ered for about 10 percent of the total amount of insurance on the structure of
the home.

### 2. Coverage for Personal Belongings
Furniture, clothes, sports equipment and other personal items are covered if
they are stolen or destroyed by fire, hurricane or other insured disaster. Most
companies provide coverage for 50 to 70 percent of the amount of insurance on
the structure of a home. This part of the policy includes off-premises coverage.
This means that belongings are covered anywhere in the world, unless the poli-
cyholder has decided against off-premises coverage. Expensive items like jewelry,
furs and silverware are covered, but there are usually dollar limits if they are sto-
len. To insure these items to their full value, individuals can purchase a special
personal property endorsement or floater and insure the item for its appraised
value.
Trees, plants and shrubs are also covered under standard homeowners insur-
ance—generally up to about $500 per item. Perils covered are theft, fire, light-
ning, explosion, vandalism, riot and even falling aircraft. They are not covered
for damage by wind or disease.

### 3. Umbrella Insurance Liability Protection
Liability coverage protects against the cost of lawsuits for bodily injury or prop-
erty damage that policyholders or family members cause to other people. It also
pays for damage caused by pets. The liability portion of the policy pays for both
the cost of defending the policyholder in court and any court awards—up to the
limit of the policy. Coverage is not just in the home but extends to anywhere
in the world. Liability limits generally start at about $100,000. However, experts
recommend that homeowners purchase at least $300,000 worth of protection.
An umbrella or excess liability policy, which provides broader coverage, includ-
ing claims for libel and slander, as well as higher liability limits, can be added to
the policy. Generally, umbrella policies cost between $200 to $350 for $1 mil-
lion of additional liability protection.
Homeowners policies also provide no-fault medical coverage. In the event
that someone is injured in a policyholder’s home, the injured person can sim-
ply submit medical bills to the policyholder’s insurance company. In this way
expenses are paid without a liability claim being filed. This coverage, however,
does not pay the medical bills for the policyholder’s own family or pets.

### 4. Additional Living Expenses
This pays the additional costs of living away from home if a house is inhabit-
able due to damage from a fire, storm or other insured disaster. It covers hotel
bills, restaurant meals and other extra living expenses incurred while the home
is being rebuilt. Coverage for additional living expenses differs from company to
company. Many policies provide coverage for about 20 percent of the insurance
on a house. The coverage can be increased for an additional premium. Some
companies sell a policy that provides an unlimited amount of loss-of-use cover-
age, but for a limited amount of time.
Additional living expense coverage also reimburses homeowners who rent
out part of their home for the rent that would have been collected from a ten-
ant if the home had not been destroyed.

## Types of Homeowners Insurance Policies at Umbrella Insurance
There are several types of homeowners insurance policies that differ in the amount
of insurance coverage they provide. The different types are fairly standard through-
out the country. However, individual states and companies may offer policies that
are slightly different or go by other names such as “standard” or “deluxe.” People
who rent the homes they live in have specific renters policies.

The various types of homeowners insurance policies are listed below.
- HO-3: This is the most common policy and protects the home from all
perils except those specifically excluded.
- HO-1: Limited coverage policy
This “bare bones” policy provides coverage against the first 10 disasters. It is
no longer available in most states.
- HO-2: Basic policy
A basic policy provides protection against all 16 disasters. There is a version
of HO-2 designed for mobile homes.
- HO-8: Older home
Designed for older homes, this policy usually reimburses for damage on an
actual cash value basis, which means replacement cost less depreciation. Full
replacement cost policies may not be available for some older homes.
- HO4: Renter
Created specifically for people who rent the home they live in, this policy
protects personal possessions and any parts of the apartment that the
policyholder owns, such as newly installed kitchen cabinets, against all 16
disasters.
- H0-6: Condo/Co-op
A policy for people who own a condo or co-op, it provides coverage for
belongings and the structural parts of the building that they own. It protects
against all 16 disasters.
What Type of Disasters Are Covered?
Most homeowners policies cover the 16 disasters listed below. Some “bare bones”
policies only cover the first 10:
- Fire or lightning
- Windstorm or hail
- Explosion
- Riot or civil commotion
- Damage caused by aircraft
- Damage caused by vehicles
Smoke
- Vandalism or malicious mischief
- Theft
- Volcanic eruption
- Falling object
- Weight of ice, snow or sleet
- Accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from within a plumbing,
heating, air conditioning, or automatic fire-protective sprinkler system, or
from a household appliance
- Sudden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning, or bulging of a
steam or hot water heating system, an air conditioning or automatic fire-
protective system
- Freezing of a plumbing, heating, air conditioning or automatic, fire-
protective sprinkler system, or of a household appliance
- Sudden and accidental damage from artificially generated electrical current
(does not include loss to a tube, transistor or similar electronic component)

## Standard Homeowners Policy Exclusions
Standard homeowners policies exclude coverage for flood, earthquake, war,
nuclear accident, landslide, mudslide, sinkhole. Some of these exclusions are
discussed below.
1. Floods
Flood damage is excluded under standard homeowners and renters insurance poli-
cies. Flood coverage, however, is available in the form of a separate policy both
from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and from a few private insurers.
Additional information on flood insurance can be found on the FloodSmart.gov
Web site or by calling 888-379-9531. For coverage over and above the $250,000
limit for property and $100,000 for contents provided by the NFIP, excess flood
insurance is available from private insurance companies. (See Topic on Flood
Insurance on page 47 for further information.)
Tsunamis cause flood damage and are therefore only covered by a flood policy.
2. Earthquakes
Earthquake coverage can be a separate policy or an endorsement to a home-
owners or renters policy. It is available from most insurance companies. In
California, it is also available from the California Earthquake Authority, a pri-
vately funded, publically managed organization. In earthquake prone states like
California, the policy comes with a high deductible.
3. Damage Resulting from “Faulty, Defective or Inadequate” Maintenance,
Workmanship, Construction or Materials
Defective products can include construction materials. An insurance policy will
not cover damage due to lack of maintenance, mold, termite infestation and
infestation from other pests. It is the policyholder’s responsibility to take rea-
sonable precautions to protect the home from damage.

## Levels of Coverage
There are three coverage options.
1. Actual Cash Value
This type of coverage pays to replace the home or possessions minus a deduc-
tion for depreciation.
2. Replacement Cost
This type of coverage pays the cost of rebuilding or repairing the home or
replacing possessions without a deduction for depreciation.
3. Guaranteed/Extended Replacement Cost
An extended replacement cost policy pays a certain percentage, generally 20-25
percent, over the coverage limit to rebuild the home in the event that materials
and labor costs are pushed up by a widespread disaster, for example. For exam-
ple, if homeowners take out a policy for $100,000, they can get up to an extra
$20,000 or $25,000 of coverage.
Some companies offer a guaranteed replacement cost policy, which pays
whatever it costs to rebuild the home as it was before the fire or other disaster,
even if it exceeds the policy limit. This gives protection against sudden increases
in construction costs due to a shortage of building materials after a widespread
disaster or other unexpected situations. It generally does not cover the cost
of upgrading the house to comply with current building codes. However, an
endorsement (or an addition to) the policy called Ordinance or Law can help
pay for these additional costs.
Guaranteed and extended replacement cost policies are more expensive; but
can offer excellent financial protection against disasters. This type of coverage,
however, may not be available in all states or from all companies.

## Umbrella Business Insurance
Umbrella insuarnce offers businesses the following four types of insurance:

## 1. Property Insurance
Umbrella Property insurance compensates a business if the property used in the business
is lost or damaged as the result of various types of common perils, such as fire
or theft. Property insurance covers not just a building or structure but also the
contents, including office furnishings, inventory, raw materials, machinery,
computers and other items vital to a business’s operations. Depending on the
type of policy, property insurance may include coverage for equipment break-
down, removal of debris after a fire or other destructive event, some types of
water damage and other losses.

### Business Interruption Insurance
Also known as business income insurance, business interruption insurance is
a type of property insurance. A business whose property has sustained a direct
physical loss such as fire damage or a damaged roof due to a tree falling on it
in a windstorm and has to close down completely while the premises are being
repaired may lose out to competitors. A quick resumption of business after a
disaster is essential. That is why business interruption insurance is so important.
There are typically three types of business interruption insurance. A business
can purchase any one or combination of these.
- Business Income Coverage: Compensates for lost income if a company
has to vacate its premises due to disaster-related damage that is covered
under the property insurance policy. Business income insurance covers the
profits the company would have earned, based on financial records, had
the disaster not occurred. The policy also covers operating expenses, such
as electricity, that continue even though business activities have come to a
temporary halt.
- Extra Income Coverage: Reimburses the company for a reasonable sum of
money that it spends, over and above normal operating expenses, to avoid
having to shut down during the restoration period.
- Contingent Business Interruption Insurance: Protects a businessowner’s
earnings following physical loss or damage to the property of the insured’s
suppliers or customers, as opposed to its own property.
Damage due to floods, earthquakes and acts of terrorism are generally not
covered by standard business property insurance but can be purchased through
various markets.

### Protection Against Flood Damage
Property insurance policies include flood damage in all states except Arizona.
Businesses should find out from their local government office or commercial
bank whether their business is located in a flood zone and whether their loca-
tion has been flooded in the past. Flood insurance is available through the fed-
eral government’s National Flood Insurance Program (www.FloodSmart.gov),
which is serviced by private carriers, and from a few specialty insurers.

### Protection Against Earthquake Damage
Coverage for earthquake damage is excluded in most property insurance poli-
cies, including businessowners package policies. Businesses in an earthquake-
prone area will need a special earthquake insurance policy or commercial prop-
erty earthquake endorsement.

### Protection Against Terrorist Attack Losses
Under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 and its extensions, only busi-
nesses that purchase optional terrorism coverage are covered for losses arising
from terrorist acts. The exception is workers compensation, which covers work-
related injuries and deaths including those due to acts of terrorism.

## 2. Liability Insurance
Any enterprise can be sued. Customers may claim that the business caused them
harm as the result of, for example, a defective product, an error in a service or
disregard for another person’s property. Or a claimant may allege that the busi-
ness created a hazardous environment. Liability insurance pays damages for
which the business is found liable, up to the policy limits, as well as attorneys’
fees and other legal defense expenses. It also pays the medical bills of any peo-
ple injured by, or on the premises of, the business.
A Commercial General Liability (CGL) insurance policy is the first line of
defense against many common claims. CGL policies cover claims in four basic
categories of business liability:
- Bodily injury
- Property damage
- Personal injury (including slander or libel)
- Advertising injury (damage from slander or false advertising)
In addition to covering claims listed above, CGL policies also cover the cost of
defending or settling claims. General liability insurance policies always state the
maximum amount that the insurer will pay during the policy period.

There are two major forms of liability insurance policies a business can select:
occurrence and claims made. Both types of policies have their advantages.

- Occurrence Policy: An occurrence policy covers a business for harm to
others caused by incidents that occurred while a policy is in force, no
matter when the claim is filed. For example, a person might sue a business
in 2010 for an injury stemming from a fall in 1999. The policy that was in
place when the incident occurred (i.e. 1999) will apply, even if the company
now has a policy in place with higher limits. Occurrence coverage may not
be available in some states or for some industries or professions.

- Claims Made Policy: A claims made policy covers the business based on
the policy that is in force when the claim is made, regardless of when the
incident occurred. In the above example, the limits in the policy in effect
in 2010 would apply. Businesses with claims made policies can purchase
optional “tail coverage.” Tail coverage enables a business to report claims
after the policy has ended for alleged injuries that occurred while the policy
was in effect.

## 3. Commercial Vehicle Insurance
A commercial auto policy provides coverage for vehicles that are used primar-
ily in connection with commercial establishments or business activities. The
insurance pays any costs to third parties resulting from bodily injury or property
damage for which the business is legally liable up to the policy limits.
While the major coverages are the same, commercial auto policies differs
from a personal auto policy in a number of technical respects. They may have
higher limits and/or provisions that cover rented and other non-owned vehicles,
including employees’ cars driven for company business. Several insurers offer
business auto policies geared to owners of small businesses or specific types of
businesses.

## 4. Workers Compensation Insurance
Employers have a legal responsibility to their employees to make the workplace
safe. However, despite precautions, accidents can occur. To protect employers
from lawsuits resulting from workplace accidents and to provide medical care
and compensation for lost income to employees hurt in workplace accidents,
in almost every state businesses are required by law to buy workers compensa-
tion insurance. Workers compensation insurance covers workers injured on the
job, whether they are hurt on the workplace premises or elsewhere, or in auto
accidents while on business. It also covers work-related illnesses. Workers com-
pensation provides payments to injured workers, without regard to who was at
fault in the accident, for time lost from work and for medical and rehabilitation
services. It also provides death benefits to surviving spouses and dependents.
Each state has different laws governing the amount and duration of lost income
benefits, the provision of medical and rehabilitation services and how the sys-
tem is administered. For example, in most states there are regulations that cover
whether the worker or employer can choose the doctor who treats the injuries
and how disputes about benefits are resolved.
Workers compensation insurance must be bought as a separate policy.
In-home business and businessowners policies (BOPs) are sold as package poli-
cies but do not include coverage for workers’ injuries.

## Other Types of Business Coverages
The first four coverages discussed below are different types of liability insurance
policies available to businesses. The fifth is a form of life insurance. There are
also specialized liability policies geared to specific types of businesses.

1. Errors and Omissions Insurance/Professional Liability
Some businesses involve services such as giving advice, making recommenda-
tions, designing things, providing physical care or representing the needs of
others, which can lead to being sued by customers, clients or patients claiming
that the business’ failure to perform a job properly has injured them. Errors and
omissions or professional liability insurance covers these situations. The policy
will pay any judgment for which the insured is legally liable, up to the policy
limit. It also provides legal defense costs, even when there has been no wrong-
doing.

2. Employment Practices Liability Insurance
Employment practices liability insurance covers, up to the policy limits, dam-
ages for which an employer is legally liable such as violating an employee’s civil
or other legal rights. In addition to paying a judgment for which the insured is
liable, it also provides legal defense costs, which can be substantial even when
there has been no wrongdoing.

3. Directors and Officers Liability Insurance
Directors and officers liability insurance protects directors and officers of corpo-
rations or nonprofit organizations if there is a lawsuit claiming they managed
the business or organization without proper regard for the rights of others. The
policy will pay any judgment for which the insured is legally liable, up to the
policy limit. It also provides for legal defense costs, even where there has been
no wrongdoing.

4. Umbrella or Excess Policies
As the name implies, an umbrella liability policy provides coverage over and
above a business’s other liability coverages. It is designed to protect against
unusually high losses, providing protection when the policy limits of one of the
underlying policies have been used up. For a typical business, an umbrella poli-
cy would provide protection beyond Its general liability and auto liability poli-
cies. If a company has employment practices liability insurance, directors and
officers liability, or other types of liability insurance, the umbrella could provide
protection beyond those policy limits as well. Cost depends on the nature of the
business, its size, the type of risks the business faces and the ways the business
implements risk reduction.

## 5. Key Person Life Insurance
The loss of a key person can be a major blow to a small business if that person
is the founder of the business or is the key contact for customers and suppliers
and the management of the business. Loss of the key person may also make the
running of the business less efficient and result in a loss of capital. Losses caused
by the death of a key employee are insurable. Such policies compensate the
business against significant losses that result from that person’s death or disabil-
ity. The amount and cost of insurance needed for a particular business depends
on the situation and the age, health and role of the key employee. Key employ-
ee life insurance pays a death benefit to the company when the key employee
dies. The policy is normally owned by the company, which pays the premiums
and is the beneficiary. The monies from key person insurance can be used to
buy back shares in a company from the estate of the deceased, pay a head hunt-
ing firm to find a suitable replacement and cover costs or expenses while the
business adjusts to the loss.

## Package Policies
Umbrella Insurance offer coverages separately and/or offer policies that combine
protection from most major property and liability risks in one package. Package
policies are created for types of businesses that generally face the same kind and
degree of risk.

1. Packages for Small Businesses
Smaller companies often purchase a package policy known as the Business-
owners Policy, or BOP. A BOP is recommended for most small businesses (usual-
ly 100 employees or less), as it is often the most affordable way to obtain broad
coverage. BOPs are “off the shelf” policies combining many of the basic coverag-
es needed by a typical small business into a standard package at a premium that
is generally less than would be required to purchase these coverages separately.
Combining both property and liability insurance, a BOP will cover a business in
the event of property damage, suspended operations, lawsuits resulting from
bodily injury or property damage to others, etc. BOPs do not cover professional
liability, auto insurance, workers compensation or health and disability insur-
ance. Small businesses will need separate insurance policies to cover professional
services, vehicles and employees.

2. Commercial Multiple Peril Policies
Larger companies might purchase a commercial package policy or customize
their policies to meet the special risks they face. Commercial multiple peril poli-
cies, often purchased by corporations, bundle property, boiler and machinery,
crime and general liability coverage together. Larger firms employee a risk man-
ager to help determine the company’s exposure to certain risks.

3. In-Home Business Policies
There are several insurance options designed to address the special needs of
home businesses.
- Homeowners Policy Endorsement: Homeowners may be able to add a
simple endorsement or rider to their existing homeowners policy to increase
coverage.
- In-Home Business Policy: An in-home business policy provides more
comprehensive coverage for business equipment and liability than a
homeowners policy endorsement. Many insurance companies offer
insurance policies specifically tailored to small business.
- Businessowners Policy (BOP): The home business might be eligible for
The Businessowners Policy (BOP), see above. The key to whether a business
owner is eligible for a BOP is the size of the premises, the limits of liability
required, the type of commercial operation it is and the extent of its
off-premises servicing and processing activities. A BOP, like an in-home
business policy, covers business property and equipment, loss of income,
extra expense and liability; however, the BOP provides these coverages on a
much broader scale.
